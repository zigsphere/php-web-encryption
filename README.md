# php-web-encryption
web-based php password encryption

This is a simple php web-based application that prompts for a password (or text) and encrypts it using all of the built-in php hash algorithms.

The original code was indeed forked and only used sha1 and sha256 hashed, but I re-wrote it to use all of the algorithms to show what the given
text would look like using all of the php hash algorithms.
